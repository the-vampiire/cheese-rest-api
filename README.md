notes
- mysql bug: `SequelizeConnectionError: Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client`
  - solution: `alter user 'USER'@'localhost' identified with mysql_native_password by 'PASSWORD'`
- removing join table attributes from query results
  - `joinTableAttributes: []`
    - [solution from here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42293075/7542831)
- model names as Caps but as lowercase in instance props
  - add alias to association and queries / scopes
- automatic eager loading of associations
  - **does not apply to create / save / update**
    - use `setDataValue('alias', instance.getAssociation())`
  - use `defaultScope` option in model definition
    - use `include: []` syntax - don't forget aliases!
